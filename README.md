Image recogization has always been an excited field of Deep Learning. In this project, we will build a Deep Neural Networks model to distinguish cat and dog images. 

In particular, we will use CNN and MobileNetv2 then compare the result given by the two model. The best model will then be delivered into a FlaskApp. 

On the FlaskApp, user can input their cat/dog photos for prediction. On the developing side, if the prediction is wrong, user can report it and the data will be sent back and stored in the PostgreSQL database for further model improving.  

The project flow chart can be visualized like this.

The dataset is acquired from the Kaggle competition 6 years ago.
